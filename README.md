# GiphyExample
Sample iOS app using the Giphy API to search and display trending gifs.

### How it Works
On launch only, recent search terms will be displayed. Search terms can be tapped or the user can do a new search, and previews of gifs containing these terms will populate the view. Gifs can be tapped to display gif in full size.
